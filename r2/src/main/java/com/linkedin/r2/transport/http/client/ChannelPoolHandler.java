/**
 * Listens for upstream events affecting the state of the channel as it relates to the pool.
 * This handler does not call super because it expects to be the last handler in the pipeline,
 * to ensure that every other handler has had a chance to process the event and finish with
 * the channel.
 *
 * Basically, the handler's job is to return the channel to the pool, or ask the pool to
 * dispose of the channel, after the response is received or after an error occurs.
 *
 * The handler operates as a singleton (it can be a member of multiple pipelines).  The handler
 * expects that its {@link ChannelHandlerContext} will be an object of type
 * AsyncPool&lt;Channel&gt;.
